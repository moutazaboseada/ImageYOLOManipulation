# YOLO Dataset Preperation 
This application is developed for easier data preparation for YOLO.
The application can do (after loading all images in folder)
1-Create Images Annotation, and create a rotated 90 degree version to increase the dataset.
2-Play Dataset with different speed with the ability to show only images with annotated objects or images without any annotation or both.
3-Change Class number for all images, and text file with all 90% of images for training and 10% of images for test.
4-show statistics of all images in the folder ( how many images, images with object count and images without object count)
Future work
1-ability to create project with all images of different classes
2-create all needed yolo files:
  a-yolocfg file modifications
  b-names and data files.
  c-annotate from video.
